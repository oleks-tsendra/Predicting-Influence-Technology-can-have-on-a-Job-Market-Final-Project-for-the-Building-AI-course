# Predicting Influence Technology can have on a Job Market
Final Project for the Building AI course

Building AI course project

## Summary

While technological advancements such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing sure have a great number of benefits it is important to remember that their implementation has risks as well. Looking at the history of technological development in general, from the industrial revolution to the creation of the Internet, to AI, it is clear that while many people can benefit from it, some end up suffering. Surely, technological progress allowed us to automize menial, repetitive, and even dangerous activities. However, people who were performing those activities were mostly left unprotected and overlooked. Even nowadays, jobs that are prone to automatization are mostly within the fields of manufacturing, transportation, and customer service. And it mostly affects people from lower-income regions with lower levels of education. Therefore, even if AI creates a new field of opportunities, new jobs – are usually not the ones that are accessible to people who are laid off due to automatization. But what if AI is used to tackle the issue AI creates? What if we would be able to observe and predict which professions, where, and when are likely to be affected? We could prepare and prevent unfortunate outcomes for workers in affected fields.

## Background

Since I have experience working in customer service and data entry fields, I could firsthand observe how automation gradually absorbs many processes that were otherwise done by humans. And while such transition takes quite a long time and a lot of effort it is inevitable. And while automatization is exceedingly effective in terms of time efficiency, long-term cost reduction, and providing an opportunity for employees to focus on more complex and creative tasks, there is a risk that many may not have a possibility to adapt to such changes and may end up losing their career opportunities. I believe that creating a system on a governmental level that predicts the impact technological advancement could have on different professions, with such specifications as time and location would help to predict and prevent unemployment. It would assist in planning the financial aid budget, for instance, for accessible courses of re-skilling for individuals that are or may be affected by technological adaptation.

## How is it used? Data sources and AI methods.

A platform for governmental employees can be created. It would show the current and future trends of automatization of different professions. Let’s take Poland as an example because Statistical Office in Poland has good access to data that is essential for creating such a planform. 
Firstly, we would use the data from the last few decades from Statistical Office in Poland. The data could be gathered and classified to show employment/unemployment ratings based on profession, region, and development over time. Secondly, we would need to gather data from different companies that apply automatization, the time of application, the use, and its success rate. Applying logistic regression to gathered data makes it possible to discover correlations and predict the future trend of job automatization.

## Challenges

Governmental fundings for social studies are usually quite limited and creating such a platform requires financial resources and time. Additionally, it would be hard to predict if AI would indeed find the correlation between automatization and job loss. Thus, before funding such a project additional studies are needed.

## What next?

Such a project would continue an important conversation on how technological development impacts human life. I would hope it would inspire more people to be interested in AI and its influence.
